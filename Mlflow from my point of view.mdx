MLflow consists of multiple blocks with multiple functionality which help us simplify the ML workflow.
In simpler words, Mlflow will help us in various stage of our ML development and deployment.

Given below are key functionally offered by Mlflow

- MLflow Tracking
- MLflow Deployments Server for LLMs
- MLflow LLM Evaluate
- MLflow Projects
- MLflow Models
- Model Registry


## MLflow Tracking 
This is the real reason to use MLflow. Tracking facilitates will help us to visualize and understand how our Machine learning model is behaving. 
If i change any variable, It will help us to find the best possible case. 

In other word MLflow allows you us log and compare multiple runs of your machine learning experiments. You can easily track different configurations, hyperparameters, and outcomes.
