MLflow consists of multiple blocks with multiple functionality which help us simplify the ML workflow.
In simpler words, Mlflow will help us in various stage of our ML development and deployment.

Given below are key functionally offered by Mlflow

- MLflow Tracking
- MLflow Projects
- MLflow Models
- Model Registry
- MLflow Deployments Server for LLMs
- MLflow LLM Evaluate


## MLflow Tracking 
This is the real reason to use MLflow. Tracking facilitates will help us to visualize and understand how our Machine learning model is behaving. 

For example: We are working on our ML/DL project with the help of multiple developers. Every developer tries to get the best accuracy out of the model. But how can we compare everyone's implementation?
MLflow will help us in this situation. It will track every parameter, metric, artifact, data, and environment configuration. which will help us understand through GUI form.

In other word MLflow allows us to log and compare multiple runs of our machine learning experiments. We can easily track different configurations, hyperparameters, and outcomes.


## MLflow Projects
At the core, MLflow Projects are just a convention for organizing and describing your code to let other data scientists (or automated tools) run it. 
Each project is simply a directory of files, or a Git repository, containing your code. MLflow can run some projects based on a convention for placing files in this directory.

I suggest to visit given link for more detail explanation -> [MLflow Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) 


## MLflow Models

## Model Registry

## MLflow Deployments Server for LLMs
A major advantage of using the MLflow Deployments Server is its centralized management of API keys.
