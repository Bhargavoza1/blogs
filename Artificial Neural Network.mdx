I have always been intrigued by the workings of the human brain and how it enables us to comprehend various sounds and discern the intricacies of colors. 
With each new piece of knowledge I acquire, I realize that there are numerous concepts at play in our quest for understanding.

The human brain is an incredibly intricate and advanced organ, and its ability to process information and perceive details is a result of complex neural mechanisms. However, what is the fundamental concept that underlies these processes? 
Mathematics and wave functions emerge as key players in explaining and comprehending the mechanisms of perception and information processing within the brain. In this blog, we will solely focus on the role of Mathematics in this regard.

Now, let's delve into a fascinating realm that bridges the sophistication of the human brain with cutting-edge technologyâ€”artificial neural networks.

# Neural Network

A neural network is like a team of interconnected perceptrons (basic computing units) that imitates, in a simplified way, how the human brain works. 
Each perceptron is connected to others, and during learning, these connections get adjusted. While it's inspired by the brain,It's a simpler model created for specific tasks, not as complex as the real thing.
