I was always wondering how our brain works. How we are able to understand the different types of sounds. How can we distinguish the colours and its details? As I learn new things, I am able to understand in this world, there are multiple concepts to find my answer. 

Our brain is an incredibly complex and sophisticated organ, and the processes involved in understanding sounds, distinguishing colors, and perceiving details are a result of intricate neural mechanisms.

But what is the major concept behind this? A universal language, the  Mathematics and wave functions play crucial roles in explaining and understanding the processes of perception and information processing in the brain.in this blog we are only focusing on Mathematics.



A neural network is like a team of interconnected perceptrons (basic computing units) that imitates, in a simplified way, how the human brain works. 
Each perceptron is connected to others, and during learning, these connections get adjusted. While it's inspired by the brain,It's a simpler model created for specific tasks, not as complex as the real thing.
