I have always been intrigued by the workings of the human brain and how it enables us to comprehend various sounds and discern the intricacies of colors. 
With each new piece of knowledge I acquire, I realize that there are numerous concepts at play in our quest for understanding.

The human brain is an incredibly intricate and advanced organ, and its ability to process information and perceive details is a result of complex neural mechanisms. However, what is the fundamental concept that underlies these processes? 
Mathematics and wave functions emerge as key players in explaining and comprehending the mechanisms of perception and information processing within the brain. In this blog, we will solely focus on the role of Mathematics in this regard.

Now, let's delve into a fascinating realm that bridges the sophistication of the human brain with cutting-edge technologyâ€”artificial neural networks.

## Biological Neuron
The human brain consists of a complex network of billions of interconnected neurons. Neurons play a crucial role in processing and transmitting chemical and electrical signals. 
Cell nucleus(core) or Soma processes the information received from dendrites. Axon is a cable that is used by neurons to send information. Synapse is the connection between an axon and other neuron dendrites. 
Dendrites, on the other hand, are extensions that receive information from neighboring neurons. 
his brief statement provides us short idea of how our neuron cell behave.

## Artificial Neuron
Artificial neuron, also referred to as perceptrons, serve as the fundamental building blocks of neural networks. 
These mathematical functions are derived from the structure of biological neurons and can be likened to basic logic gates that produce binary outputs. They are occasionally referred to as perceptrons as well.


**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**  
Let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$.
Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$,
$F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$. $\sqrt{a}$

 The **Pythagorean equation**: $a=\sqrt{b^2 + c^2}$.

# Neural Network
A neural network is like a team of interconnected perceptrons (basic computing units) that imitates, in a simplified way, how the human brain works. 
Each perceptron is connected to others, and during learning, these connections get adjusted. While it's inspired by the brain,It's a simpler model created for specific tasks, not as complex as the real thing.
