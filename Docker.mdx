Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that can run applications and their dependencies. 
Docker provides a way to package and distribute applications in a consistent and reproducible manner by encapsulating them in containers.

Containers provide isolation between each other and the underlying system, ensuring uniformity across various environments. Docker utilizes containerization technology to accomplish this, 
enabling the bundling of an application and its dependencies into a singular entity known as a container. These containers can be effortlessly deployed and executed on any Docker-supported system, delivering a consistent runtime environment.

# Key Features of Docker 

1. **Portability**: Docker containers are highly portable, enabling seamless deployment across various platforms and environments, including physical servers, virtual machines, and cloud platforms.

2. **Isolation**: Containers run as isolated processes, providing resource isolation and preventing conflicts between applications. This ensures stability and security by preventing one application from affecting another.

3. **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by creating multiple instances of a container. This allows for increased resource utilization and improved performance.

4. **Version Control**: Docker provides a version control system for containers, enabling developers to track changes and easily roll back to previous versions if necessary.

5. **Simplified Deployment**: Docker simplifies the deployment process by providing a standardized way to package and deploy applications. This reduces the time and effort required for deployment.
