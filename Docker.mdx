Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that can run applications and their dependencies. 
Docker provides a way to package and distribute applications in a consistent and reproducible manner by encapsulating them in containers.

Containers provide isolation between each other and the underlying system, ensuring uniformity across various environments. Docker utilizes containerization technology to accomplish this, 
enabling the bundling of an application and its dependencies into a singular entity known as a container. These containers can be effortlessly deployed and executed on any Docker-supported system, delivering a consistent runtime environment.
